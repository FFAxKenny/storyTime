Trifid
------
Trifid is a management software for handling project environments for artists.
The primary purpose of Trifid is to allow artists to benefit from tools and
workflows that are project dependent by setting up an environment specific
to each project.  Trifid provides easy ways of setting up or changing these
environments on a per user basis. All other tools in the pipeline can then
use information about the environment that was setup through Trifid.



Features
--------
- GUI for setting/changing the current users project
- PyQt, Maya and Nuke interfaces
- Integrated with Shotgun to provide accurate info about projects
- Management of developer environment vars for things like debugging info
- Mapping and unmapping of network paths for local machine/user


Usage
-----



Setup and Installation
----------------------
There are multiple distribution locations for Trifid, for use in multiple apps.
To customize the installation prefixes check setup_py.cfg or setup_maya.cfg.
When a setup_*.py script is run, the matching cfg file is copied to setup.cfg.


Building the Windows Exe
------------------------
To build the Trifid.exe you need to have the moonbot development environment
setup (c:/moonbot/tech/tools/python/) or change setup_py.cfg to match your settings.
Then you can use the two setup scripts to build the exe:

$ python setup_py.py install
$ python seutp_exe.py py2exe

This will install the package into a sourceable python location, then build
the exe from the installed package.


Building for Maya
-----------------
To install the source for use in Maya, use setup_maya.py:

$ python setup_maya.py install
